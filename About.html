                        <p> An unidentified flying object or "UFO" is an object perceived in the sky that is not readily identified. Most UFOs are later identified as conventional objects or phenomena. The term is widely used for claimed observations of extraterrestrial craft.</p>
                        <!-- <p> Unexplained aerial observations have been reported throughout history. Some were undoubtedly astronomical in nature: comets, bright meteors, one or more of the five planets that can be readily seen with the naked eye, planetary conjunctions, or atmospheric optical phenomena such as parhelia and lenticular clouds. An example is Halley's Comet, which was recorded first by Chinese astronomers in 240 BC and possibly as early as 467 BC. Such sightings throughout history often were treated as supernatural portents, angels, or other religious omens. Some current-day UFO researchers have noticed similarities between some religious symbols in medieval paintings and UFO reports though the canonical and symbolic character of such images is documented by art historians placing more conventional religious interpretations on such images.</p> -->
                        <p> This study is based on some of the sightings from Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and United States between 2010 and 2014. A total of 23,820 sightings were taken into consideration for this study during this timeline. A majority of the sightings were noticed in United States(22,991). The shapes of the UFOs are also analyzed, with a majority of sightings in the shape of light(5,253).</p>
